Say hi to me on [twitter!](https://twitter.com/infinitejust1)

Ran into scheduling problems so I had abandoned this back in March 2021.
I tried:
    - a random script scheduler which turned out to be paid back in March 2021
    - Heroku but without a scheduler, I realized I wouldve had to write a scheduler so I...procrastinated

So as of Oct 2021, I finally wrote that simple scheduler for automating tweets. Let's see what happens, since I can only run 2 dynos at a time, a worker and either the webserver or clock.
